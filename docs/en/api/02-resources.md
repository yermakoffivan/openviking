# Resource Management

Resources are external knowledge that agents can reference. This module provides functionality for adding, importing/exporting, and uploading temporary files for resources.

## Core Concepts

### Resource Types

OpenViking supports various resource types, categorized by functionality:

**Documents**

| Type | Extensions | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| PDF | `.pdf` | Supports local parsing and MinerU API conversion |
| Markdown | `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdown`, `.mkd` | Native support, extracts structure and stores in segments |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` | Cleans navigation/ads and extracts content, converts to Markdown |
| Word | `.docx` | Extracts text, headings, tables and converts to Markdown |
| Plain Text | `.txt`, `.text` | Direct import and processing |
| EPUB | `.epub` | E-book format, supports ebooklib or manual extraction |

**Spreadsheets & Presentations**

| Type | Extensions | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Excel | `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.xlsm` | Supports new and legacy Excel formats, converts to Markdown tables by worksheet |
| PowerPoint | `.pptx` | Extracts content by slide, supports extracting notes |

**Code**

| Type | Resource Name | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Code Files | `*.py`, `*.js`, ... | Supports common programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, etc.) |
| Git Protocol Repository | `git://...` | Git URL, local directory, `.zip` package, respects `.gitignore` and automatically filters `.git`, `node_modules` and other directories |
| Git Code Hosting Platform | `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}` | URLs from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and other code hosting platforms |
| Raw Files from Git Hosting | `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/raw/{branch}/{path}` | Raw file download URLs from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and other platforms |

**Media**

| Type | Resource Name | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Images | `*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`, `*.png`, `*.gif` ... | Various image formats, descriptions generated via VLM (Experimental) |
| Video | `*.mp4`, `*.avi`, `*.mov` ... | Extracts keyframes and analyzes with VLM (Planning) |
| Audio | `*.mp3`, `*.wav`, `*.m4a` ... | Performs speech transcription (Planning) |

**Cloud Documents**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Feishu/Lark | URL-based, supports doc/docx, wiki, sheets, bitable. By default uses app credentials from FEISHU_APP_ID and FEISHU_APP_SECRET; user-token imports can pass `args.feishu_access_token`, and user-token watches also pass `args.feishu_refresh_token` |

**Web Pages (recursive web crawler)**

| Type | Resource Name | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Single page / recursive crawl | `https://host/path` | By default only the entry page is fetched. Set `args.depth > 0` to crawl same-host links breadth-first; `args.max_pages` only bounds how many pages are collected. Each page is extracted to Markdown with trafilatura. Supported `args`: `depth`, `max_pages`, `include_paths`, `exclude_paths`, `allow_external_links`, `skip_download_links`. Download links discovered on pages are skipped by default (`skip_download_links=true`) to avoid importing sidecar files such as `llms.txt`; set it to `false` to download same-host file links and count them toward `max_pages`. `include_paths`/`exclude_paths` use **path-prefix** matching (e.g. `/docs/` matches only paths starting with `/docs/`, never substrings like `/blog/docs-tips`). |

> Routing: sitemap-looking URLs (`https://host/sitemap.xml`, `https://host/feed.xml`, `*.atom`, ...) and explicit `args.site=true` are delegated to the whole-website ingestion below; Git hosting URLs such as `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}` are delegated to the Code section above.

**Whole Website (sitemap / RSS / Atom)**

| Type | Resource Name | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Sitemap | `https://host/sitemap.xml`, `https://host/sitemap-index.xml` | Parses the sitemap and ingests every listed page as a single resource tree (one child node per page). Nested `<sitemapindex>` is followed recursively. The whole site becomes one resource under `viking://resources/<host>`. |
| RSS / Atom feed | `https://host/rss.xml`, `https://host/atom.xml`, `https://host/feed` | Parses RSS 2.0 / Atom and ingests each entry as a tree node; the article body is fetched from its link (or taken inline when the feed carries full content). |
| Whole-site auto-discovery | `https://host` + `args.site=true` | Forces whole-site ingestion for a bare domain or ordinary page: discovers the site's sitemap/RSS via robots.txt, HTML `<link rel="alternate">` autodiscovery, and conventional paths, then ingests it. |

Crawling is bounded and non-recursive beyond the listed pages, and is governed by the `parsers.webfeed` config (`max_pages`, `max_concurrency`, `politeness_delay`, `same_host_only`, `respect_robots`, `max_depth`); robots.txt is honored. Set `watch_interval` on a sitemap/feed URL to keep the **whole site** refreshed: on each run new pages are added and removed pages drop automatically. When adding a single homepage (without `args.site`), the response may append a one-line hint suggesting whole-site ingestion — it never auto-crawls.

### Resource Processing Pipeline

Resources go through the following processing stages when added:

```
Source Input -> Parse -> Resource Tree Build -> Persistence -> Semantic Processing
    ↓           ↓            ↓                 ↓               ↓
  URL/File    Parser    TreeBuilder        AGFS       Summarizer/Vector
```

#### Stage 1: Parse
- Uses `UnifiedResourceProcessor` to parse content based on resource type
- Supports multiple formats: documents (PDF/Markdown/Word), spreadsheets (Excel/PPT), code, media files, etc.
- Parsed results are written to a temporary VikingFS directory
- Media files have descriptions generated via VLM (Vision Language Model)

#### Stage 2: Resource Tree Build (TreeBuilder)
- `TreeBuilder.finalize_from_temp()` scans the temporary directory structure
- Builds resource tree nodes, handles URI conflicts (auto-renames)
- Establishes relationships between directories and resources

#### Stage 3: Persistence
- Checks if target URI already exists
- New resources: moves temporary files to permanent AGFS location
- Existing resources: retains temporary tree for subsequent diff comparison
- Acquires lifecycle lock to prevent concurrent modifications
- Cleans up temporary directory

#### Stage 4: Semantic Processing
- **Summary Generation**: `Summarizer` generates L0 (abstract) and L1 (overview)
- **Vector Index**: Vectorizes content for semantic search
- Processed asynchronously via `SemanticQueue`, can wait for completion with `wait=True`

#### Non-Wait Git Repository Imports
- For Git repository sources with `wait=false`, OpenViking validates the repository, resolves the target URI, reserves the final `root_uri`, and returns before clone/parse/finalize completes.
- The immediate response contains `status`, `root_uri`, and `task_id`; fetching, parsing, finalizing, and queue waiting continue in a persistent background task.
- Poll `GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}` to inspect task state. Git resource import tasks use stages such as `queued`, `fetching`, `parsing`, `finalizing`, and `processing_queue`.
- Other resource sources with `wait=false` finish fetching/parsing/finalizing before the response; their returned `task_id` tracks semantic and embedding queue completion only.

### Incremental Updates for Resources

Resource incremental updates are implemented via the **Watch Task** mechanism:

#### Watch Task Creation
- Set `watch_interval > 0` (in minutes) when calling `add_resource` with a re-readable source, such as a URL, sitemap, or RSS feed, to create a watch task
- Uploaded content referenced by `temp_file_id` is a static snapshot and cannot be watched; re-add it when the local source changes
- You may specify `to` to define the target URI; if omitted, the task binds to the `root_uri` returned by this import
- Pointing a watch at a sitemap/RSS/Atom URL keeps the **whole site** in sync: each refresh re-reads the feed and rebuilds the tree, so newly published pages are added and removed pages drop automatically
- `WatchManager` handles task persistence
- Supports multi-tenant permission control (ROOT/ADMIN/USER permission levels)

#### Task Scheduling & Execution
- `WatchScheduler` checks for expired tasks every 60 seconds
- Default concurrency control prevents duplicate execution
- Expired tasks automatically re-invoke `add_resource`
- Updates task's last execution time and next execution time

#### Task Management Operations
- **Create**: Creates new task or reactivates disabled task when `watch_interval > 0`
- **Update**: Re-sets parameters for the same target URI
- **Cancel**: Disables task when `watch_interval <= 0` for the same target URI
- **Query**: Queries task status by task ID or target URI

## API Reference

### add_resource

Add a resource to the knowledge base. The SDK supports local files/directories, URLs, and other sources. Raw HTTP calls accept remote URLs through `path` or uploaded local files through `temp_file_id`. Uploaded content is a static snapshot, so it cannot be combined with `watch_interval > 0`.

#### 1. API Implementation Overview

This endpoint is the core entry point for resource management, supporting adding resources from various sources with optional waiting for semantic processing and vectorization completion.

**Processing Flow**:
1. Identify and validate the resource source (URL or uploaded temporary file)
2. Resolve the target URI
3. Call the corresponding format Parser; `args.parse_mode` controls whether the converted Markdown body may be split
4. Build the directory tree and write to AGFS
5. Run post-ingest processing according to `processing_mode`: `semantic_and_vectors` generates semantic artifacts and vectors; `vectors_only` skips semantic understanding and only enqueues file vectorization
6. Wait for semantic processing/vectorization completion when `wait=true`; with `wait=false`, return a `task_id` for queue tracking
7. If `reason` is non-empty, append it to the fixed resource reason session and commit through the normal memory extraction pipeline so suitable user memories can reference the resource URI
8. Set up scheduled update task if `watch_interval` is specified

**Code Entry Points**:
- `sdk/python/openviking_sdk/client.py:AsyncHTTPClient.add_resource` - Python SDK entry
- `openviking/server/routers/resources.py:add_resource` - HTTP router
- `openviking/service/resource_service.py` - Core service implementation
- `crates/ov_cli/src/handlers.rs:handle_add_resource` - CLI handler

#### 2. Interface and Parameter Description

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| path | string | No | - | Remote resource URL (HTTP/HTTPS/Git). Mutually exclusive with `temp_file_id` |
| temp_file_id | string | No | - | Temporary upload file ID. Mutually exclusive with `path` |
| to | string | No | - | Target Viking URI (exact location). Mutually exclusive with `parent` |
| parent | string | No | - | Parent Viking URI (resource placed under this directory). Mutually exclusive with `to` |
| create_parent | bool | No | False | Automatically create parent directory if it does not exist (server-side flag) |
| reason | string | No | "" | Reason for adding the resource. When non-empty, OpenViking runs it through the normal session memory extraction pipeline with the resource URI and records resource references in the resulting memory |
| instruction | string | No | "" | Processing instructions for semantic extraction (experimental feature) |
| wait | bool | No | False | Whether to wait for semantic processing and vectorization to complete before returning |
| timeout | float | No | None | Timeout in seconds, only effective when `wait=True` |
| strict | bool | No | False | Whether to use strict mode |
| ignore_dirs | string | No | None | Directory names to ignore (comma-separated) |
| include | string | No | None | File patterns to include (glob) |
| exclude | string | No | None | File patterns to exclude (glob) |
| directly_upload_media | bool | No | True | Whether to directly upload media files |
| preserve_structure | bool | No | None | Whether to preserve directory structure |
| args | object | No | `{}` | Parser-specific import options forwarded to the source parser/accessor. Native HTTPS Git imports and watches accept HTTP Basic credentials over TLS as `args.auth_config={"username":"oauth2","token":"..."}`; `username` defaults to `oauth2`. Git `branch` or `commit` remains at the top level of `args`. `args.parse_mode` accepts `default` (existing splitting behavior) or `no_split` (parse and convert each source document to one Markdown body). E.g. `args.site=true/false` forces/opts out of whole-site (sitemap/RSS) ingestion, `args.max_pages` etc. override the `webfeed` config; the recursive web crawler accepts `args.depth`, `args.max_pages`, `args.include_paths`, `args.exclude_paths`, `args.allow_external_links`, `args.skip_download_links`; Feishu user-token imports pass `args.feishu_access_token`. Core `add_resource` fields such as `path`, `to`, `watch_interval`, `include`, and `exclude` are not allowed inside `args` |
| watch_interval | float | No | 0 | Scheduled update interval (minutes). >0 creates a task for a re-readable URL/sitemap/RSS source; uploaded `temp_file_id` content is a static snapshot and must be re-added when it changes. <=0 cancels a task; explicit `to` wins, otherwise binds to the imported `root_uri` |
| processing_mode | string | No | `semantic_and_vectors` | Post-ingest processing mode. `semantic_and_vectors` is the normal flow: generate semantic artifacts (`.abstract.md`, `.overview.md`) and vectors. `vectors_only` skips semantic understanding/VLM summarization and only vectorizes current resource files |
| telemetry | TelemetryRequest | No | False | Whether to return telemetry data |

**Additional Notes**:
- `to` and `parent` cannot be specified together. Use `create_parent=true` with `parent` when the parent directory should be created automatically.
- If both `to` and `parent` are omitted, the server may use the current user's `add_targets.resource_uri` override, then `server.user_config_defaults.add_targets.resource_uri`. If neither is set, legacy target resolution is unchanged.
- Resource targets may use public `viking://resources/...`, the home alias `viking://~/resources/...`, explicit user `viking://user/{user_id}/resources/...`, or peer `viking://user/{user_id}/peers/{peer_id}/resources/...` paths. The home alias is expanded to the canonical path using the authenticated request identity; the uid-less spelling `viking://user/resources/...` is rejected with an error pointing at `viking://~/resources/...`.
- `user_id` and `peer_id` path segments must be safe single-segment identifiers, for example `alice` or `web-visitor-alice`. Values with path separators, `.`, `..`, `:`, or `+` are rejected.
- `path` and `temp_file_id` cannot be specified together
- Raw HTTP calls for local files require first uploading via [temp_upload](#temp_upload) to obtain `temp_file_id`
- When `to` is specified and the target already exists, triggers incremental update
- Only Git repository sources use full background import when `wait=false`; OpenViking performs repository preflight and target planning before returning the `task_id`.
- Native HTTPS Git credentials in `args.auth_config` remain request-local when `watch_interval <= 0`. When `watch_interval > 0`, OpenViking stores the repository-bound username/token in private watch state and restores it only for later Git fetches. The credentials are excluded from ordinary queue payloads and watch API/MCP/CLI responses. Git PATs have no generic refresh flow; rotate an expired or revoked token by recreating the watch. Legacy URL-embedded credentials such as `https://user:token@host/repo.git` remain accepted and are passed through unchanged; because that URL is also the source identifier, it may be recorded in process arguments, logs, queues, resource metadata, and watch state. Prefer `args.auth_config` for new integrations. Plaintext HTTP authentication and authenticated redirects for `args.auth_config` remain rejected.
- The token travels in the HTTPS request body. Keep diagnostic request-body dumping disabled in production because explicitly enabling it can record secrets.
- Memory generated from `reason` is extracted through the same pipeline as `session.commit`. It uses `reason`, the resource URI, available source name, and available directory abstract; it does not inspect or expand the full resource content. OpenViking writes to existing memory types such as `entities`, `events`, or `preferences`, not a dedicated resource memory directory.
- When deleting a resource, OpenViking scans the self or peer memories targeted by the current context before deletion, removes the matching resource URI and content introduced by that `reason`, and refreshes the semantic index for the affected memories.
- Other sources with `wait=false` finish source parsing, target resolution, and AGFS writes before returning. Only semantic and embedding queues continue asynchronously.
- `processing_mode=vectors_only` does not call the VLM semantic-understanding stage and does not generate or refresh `.abstract.md` / `.overview.md`. For existing targets, it preserves existing semantic artifacts and existing semantic vectors. It still updates the resource tree, vectorizes current non-hidden files when `build_index=true`, and removes detail vectors for files deleted during refresh.
- `processing_mode` belongs to `add_resource`. The admin `reindex` API/CLI continues to use `mode` (`vectors_only`, `semantic_and_vectors`, `prune_orphans`) for maintenance operations on already-ingested data.
- When `watch_interval > 0`, the watch task binds to `to` if provided; otherwise it binds to the `root_uri` returned by this import. If no stable `root_uri` is available, the request fails and asks for an explicit `to`.
- Feishu/Lark app-token imports do not pass `args.feishu_access_token`. OpenViking keeps the existing app credential flow and the SDK obtains an app/tenant token from `app_id` and `app_secret`. This mode supports both one-time imports and `watch_interval > 0`.
- Feishu/Lark one-time user-token imports pass `args={"feishu_access_token": "u-..."}` with `watch_interval <= 0`. OpenViking uses that user token only for the current import and does not store it.
- Feishu/Lark user-token watches pass `args={"feishu_access_token": "u-...", "feishu_refresh_token": "r-..."}` with `watch_interval > 0`. OpenViking stores the token state in the private watch task state, refreshes it with the configured Feishu app credentials, and uses the refreshed user token for later watch runs.
- Feishu/Lark user-token watches require `FEISHU_APP_ID` and `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` (or `feishu.app_id` and `feishu.app_secret` in `ov.conf`) because Feishu refresh tokens are bound to the app that issued them. The supplied user token must come from the same Feishu app configured in OpenViking.
- Watch task token state is stored in the internal `viking://resources/.watch_tasks.json` control file and is hidden from watch API/MCP/CLI responses. If VikingFS file encryption is enabled, this control file is encrypted at rest; otherwise the server-side control file contains plaintext token state.
- For local directory inputs, scanning respects `.gitignore` files (root and nested) with standard Git semantics; `ignore_dirs`, `include`, and `exclude` further refine what is ingested.
- `args.parse_mode=no_split` still invokes the normal format Parser. PDF, Word, PowerPoint, HTML, and other supported documents are converted to Markdown, but heading-, paragraph-, and size-based splitting is skipped. A directory import applies this independently to each supported document and continues to honor `.gitignore`, filters, and `preserve_structure`.
- For a single-file input in `no_split` mode, when parsing produces exactly one visible file and `to` is omitted, that file is stored directly under the resolved parent (for example, `guide.md` becomes `viking://resources/guide.md`). No wrapper directory or directory-level `.abstract.md` / `.overview.md` is created. If parsing also produces images or other visible files, the wrapper directory is retained. An explicit `to` is always preserved as the exact final URI.
- `no_split` changes only the stored Markdown layout. Semantic processing, file vectorization, and any internal embedding chunking remain unchanged. Relative Markdown links are resolved against the same no-split output layout, so links do not point to split-only paths. A configured Understanding parser that cannot guarantee a single Markdown body returns an explicit unsupported-mode error.
- To create or update plain text directly, use [content/write](03-filesystem.md#write) instead of `add_resource`. Semantic processing and embeddings are refreshed automatically after resource ingestion and content writes.

**Response Example**

**HTTP API Response (JSON, `wait=true`)**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "status": "success",
    "root_uri": "viking://resources/guide.md",
    "temp_uri": "viking://temp/username/04291108_b62dc7/guide.md",
    "source_path": "./documents/guide.md",
    "meta": {},
    "errors": [],
    "queue_status": {
      "pending": 5,
      "processing": 2,
      "completed": 10
    }
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "operation_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

**HTTP API Response (JSON, non-Git `wait=false`)**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "status": "success",
    "root_uri": "viking://resources/guide",
    "temp_uri": "viking://temp/username/04291108_b62dc7/guide",
    "source_path": "./documents/guide.md",
    "meta": {},
    "errors": [],
    "task_id": "uuid-xxx"
  }
}
```

Use the returned `task_id` to poll `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}` for queue completion. For Git repository sources with `wait=false`, the same endpoint tracks the full background import and the completed task result contains the full import result, including `queue_status`.

**CLI Response (Default Table Format)**

```
Note: Resource is being processed in the background.
Use 'ov wait' to wait for completion, or 'ov observer queue' to check status.
status       success
root_uri     viking://resources/01-overview
task_id      uuid-xxx
```

**CLI Response (JSON Format, using -o json)**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "root_uri": "viking://resources/01-overview",
  "task_id": "uuid-xxx"
}
```

**Field Description**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Processing status: "success" or "error" |
| `root_uri` | string | Final URI of the resource in OpenViking |
| `task_id` | string | (Optional, only when `wait=false`) Task ID for polling `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`. Non-Git imports use it for queue tracking; Git repository imports use it for full background import tracking. |
| `temp_uri` | string | Temporary URI produced during import |
| `source_path` | string | Original source file path or URL |
| `meta` | object | Metadata from resource parsing (file type, size, etc.) |
| `errors` | array | List of errors encountered during processing |
| `warnings` | array | (Optional) List of warnings (only when `strict=False`) |
| `queue_status` | object | (Optional, only when `wait=true`) Queue processing status with `pending`, `processing`, `completed` counts |

**Completed add-resource task result**

For Git repository sources with `wait=false`, the background task has `task_type="add_resource"` and `resource_id` equal to the returned `root_uri`. Running task records may include `stage`. Poll `/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}` until the task completes. Its nested `result` then contains the final queue summary and `context_count`:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "task_id": "uuid-xxx",
    "task_type": "add_resource",
    "status": "completed",
    "resource_id": "viking://resources/guide",
    "result": {
      "status": "success",
      "root_uri": "viking://resources/guide",
      "queue_status": {
        "Embedding": {
          "processed": 11,
          "requeue_count": 0,
          "error_count": 0,
          "errors": []
        }
      },
      "context_count": 11
    }
  }
}
```

`context_count` is the number of contexts successfully produced and indexed by this upload task. A context is counted after its embedding record is written successfully. It is not the total number of contexts already stored under `root_uri`. If the server restarts before the task persists its final metrics, the field is omitted instead of reporting a partial count.

### temp_upload

Upload a temporary file for subsequent importing of local files via [add_resource](#add_resource) or [add_skill](#add_skill).

#### 1. API Implementation Overview

This endpoint uploads a local file into temporary server-managed storage and returns a `temp_file_id` for subsequent API calls. This is a helper endpoint typically not called directly but used automatically via the SDK or CLI.

**Processing Flow**:
1. Receive uploaded file
2. Choose temporary upload backend based on `upload_mode`
3. Save the file and record original filename
4. Return temporary file ID

**Code Entry Points**:
- `openviking/server/routers/resources.py:temp_upload` - HTTP router
- `openviking/service/resource_service.py` - Service implementation

#### 2. Interface and Parameter Description

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| file | UploadFile | Yes | - | Uploaded file (multipart/form-data) |
| telemetry | bool | No | False | Whether to return telemetry data |
| upload_mode | string | No | `"local"` | Temporary upload mode. `local` keeps the existing single-node behavior. `shared` uploads to shared temporary storage for distributed deployments. |

Notes:

- The default is `local`, so existing clients keep the original behavior unless they explicitly opt into `shared`.
- Use `upload_mode=shared` only when you explicitly want distributed shared temporary uploads.
- `shared` mode returns a `temp_file_id` in the `shared_<upload_id>` form. The same account can consume it repeatedly while it remains available.
- New shared uploads create an internal `viking://upload/<created_at_ms>-<uuid>/` directory containing `content` and `meta`. The 13-digit Unix-millisecond timestamp in the directory name is the upload creation time; `meta` is written last and marks a completed upload. These objects are not part of the normal filesystem browsing surface.
- Shared uploads remain for `server.temp_upload.ttl_seconds` (12 hours by default). Each new shared upload makes one listing of the internal upload root, parses the creation timestamp from each first-level upload directory, and recursively removes expired directories without relying on filesystem modification times.

#### 3. Usage Examples

**HTTP API**

```
POST /api/v1/resources/temp_upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1933/api/v1/resources/temp_upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -F "file=@./documents/guide.md"
```

Distributed / shared upload:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1933/api/v1/resources/temp_upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -F "file=@./documents/guide.md" \
  -F "upload_mode=shared"
```

**Python SDK**

The `add_resource`, `add_skill` and other endpoints in the Python SDK automatically handle local file uploads, no need to call this endpoint manually. To opt into distributed shared temporary uploads in HTTP client mode, set `upload.mode` to `"shared"` in `ovcli.conf`.

**Go SDK**

`client.AddResource`, `client.AddSkill`, `client.ImportOVPack`, and
`client.RestoreOVPack` automatically call `temp_upload` for local files. Set
`openviking.Config{UploadMode: "shared"}` to request shared temporary uploads.

**CLI**

CLI commands also automatically handle local file uploads, no need to call this endpoint manually.

**Response Example**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "temp_file_id": "upload_abc123def456.md"
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "operation_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

Possible shared response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "temp_file_id": "shared_7f3c1b8d4f2e4b1bb0f6e8b2d9a4c123"
  }
}
```
